 * - Screen reader OFF → use the app's text-to-speech (server voice / expo-speech).
 *
 * Content is the exception: screen-reader announcements cannot be paused,
 * replayed, or scrubbed, and are dropped outright when focus moves. A blind
 * user who missed a direction would have no way to hear it again, so answers
 * always go through app TTS where the transport controls actually apply.

 * RN Web always reports screen reader enabled but announceForAccessibility is a
 * no-op there, so web always uses in-app TTS.
